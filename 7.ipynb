    "While accuracy is a commonly used metric for evaluating classification models, it has several limitations that need to be considered. Some of these limitations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced Classes: In datasets where classes are imbalanced (i.e., one class has significantly more instances than others), accuracy may not provide an accurate representation of model performance. A model that predicts the majority class for every instance can achieve high accuracy, even if it performs poorly on minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Misleading in Skewed Distributions: Accuracy can be misleading when the class distribution in the dataset is highly skewed. For example, in a dataset where one class is rare but highly important (e.g., detecting fraud), accuracy may not adequately reflect the model's ability to correctly identify instances of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignorance of Costs: Accuracy treats all types of errors (false positives and false negatives) equally, regardless of their consequences. In many real-world applications, different types of errors have different costs or implications. For example, a false negative in medical diagnosis could have more severe consequences than a false positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive to Data Preprocessing: Accuracy can be sensitive to data preprocessing steps, such as class balancing techniques or feature scaling. Changes in data preprocessing can affect the distribution of predictions and consequently impact accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inability to Capture Uncertainty: Accuracy does not capture the uncertainty associated with predictions. In probabilistic classification tasks, where models provide probability estimates for each class, accuracy alone may not provide a complete picture of model confidence or uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, several alternative or complementary evaluation metrics can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision and Recall: Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. These metrics are particularly useful in imbalanced datasets and help assess the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's performance. It is especially valuable when there is an uneven class distribution or when both precision and recall are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC): AUC-ROC measures the ability of a model to discriminate between positive and negative instances across different threshold values. It provides insights into the model's performance across various trade-offs between true positive rate and false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost-sensitive Metrics: Cost-sensitive evaluation metrics take into account the costs associated with different types of errors. These metrics, such as cost-sensitive accuracy or cost-sensitive F1 score, assign higher penalties to misclassifications with higher costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix Analysis: Analyzing the confusion matrix provides detailed insights into the types of errors made by the model and helps identify specific areas for improvement. Techniques such as class-specific performance evaluation can address the limitations of accuracy in capturing the performance of individual classes.\n",
