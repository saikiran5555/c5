    "A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted class labels with true class labels. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class in the classification problem.\n",

    "Components of a Contingency Matrix:\n",
    "A contingency matrix typically has the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positives (TP): The number of data points that belong to a particular class and are correctly predicted by the model to belong to that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "True Negatives (TN): The number of data points that do not belong to a particular class and are correctly predicted by the model to not belong to that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "False Positives (FP): The number of data points that do not belong to a particular class but are incorrectly predicted by the model to belong to that class (Type I error).\n",
    "\n",
    "False Negatives (FN): The number of data points that belong to a particular class but are incorrectly predicted by the model to not belong to that class (Type II error).\n",

    "Usage in Performance Evaluation:\n",
    "The contingency matrix is used to compute various performance metrics that quantify the effectiveness of a classification model. Some common metrics computed from a contingency matrix include:\n",
